As expected, from their appearance, what I tasted was that over-roasted smokey/charcoal flavor overpowering any qualities of the beans.  IF these are truly high quality Jamaican Blue Mountain beans (which for the price they should be) it's a crime against nature to ruin them like this.  Leave this level of roasting to starbucks, to cover up the horrid quality of beans.

""Crunchies"" are chunks of freeze-dried pineapple shaped like canned pineapple chunks you buy at the store.  The consistency is very good and it is definitely crunchy.  But to me, the flavor was a little bit off.  I mean it didn't taste like natural pineapple.  The package states that the only ingredient is ""pineapple,"" so I can't figure out why the taste is slightly off.  I opened a second package and tried it, but it was the same.  A third package was the same.  I will not be buying this product again.
