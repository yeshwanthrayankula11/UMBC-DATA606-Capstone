The bar smelled and tasted like Vicks Vaporub, which is not exactly a pleasant thing when you're talking about food.  I will definitely not be purchasing any of their other products after this awful experience.",first larabar product tried awful bar smelled tasted like vicks vaporub not exactly pleasant thing talking food definitely not purchasing product awful experience,0.352941176,48,7/31/2007,2007,7,278
B005CUU23S,ADP8ROI8NMNL2,1,7,1,11/29/2011,What?,"This was not at all what I expected. It was like the old-school roll-on deoderant from the 1970's. Only instead of fresh-scented anti-persperant, it was drippy, smelly, bacon-flavored dog juice.<br /><br />So I guess you're supposed to stoop down and hold the roll-on bottle in front of the dog while it licks the roller ball to get the dog juice on its tongue. You're supposed to do this without yacking from the smell. Meanwhile, there's a million dog treats out there that you can throw to the dog and he runs off and eats it and you're not doing deep knee bends to apply dog juice roll-on to your dog's already funky tongue.<br /><br />To say nothing of the fact that the dog just wants to take it and bite it. Like a dog would do.<br /><br />Try again. Fail.",not expected like oldschool rollon deoderant 1970 instead freshscented antipersperant drippy smelly baconflavored dog juiceso guess supposed stoop hold rollon bottle front dog lick roller ball get dog juice tongue supposed without yacking smell meanwhile million dog treat throw dog run eats not deep knee bend apply dog juice rollon dog already funky tongueto say nothing fact dog want take bite like dog would dotry fail,0.142857143,140,11/29/2011,2011,11,763
